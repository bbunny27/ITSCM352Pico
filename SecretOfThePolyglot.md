### Step 1) 
The challenge reads as follows: "The Network Operations Center (NOC) of your local institution picked up a suspicious file, they're getting conflicting information on what type of file it is. They've brought you in as an external expert to examine the file. Can you extract all the information from this strange file?"  
They then provide you with this [file](flag2of2-final.pdf).  
### Step 2)
If you open the PDF document, it will show you this image: ![Pic of Document](screenshotOfPDF.png)

"1n_pn9_&_pdf_2a6a1ea8}"
### Step 3)
Let's see what is wrong with this file. I will use a hex editor to search the hex code and ensure that it has the correct file extension.
