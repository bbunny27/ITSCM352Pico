### If you are Dr. Yin or Classmate reading this:
1) Click on the folder within the Repo that is named after the CTF Challenge you want to view.   
2) Look for the file called (NameOfChallenge).md    
3) This is a markdown document. I chose this format as It is easy to read, and allows me to create the document in a cohesive manner, while utilizing git for version control.
